 * C++17 extends aggregates to also include structures deriving from other classes/structs.
 * The other rules still apply, aggregates are either arrays or structs which
 * – no user-declared or explicit constructor
 * – no constructor inherited by a using declaration
 * – no private or protected non-static data members
 * – no virtual functions
 * – no virtual, private, or protected base classes
